## Pre-Conference Workshop

[**PREWS17 - Advancing Open Science: Greenhouse Gas Emission Data Analysis Using the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center’s Jupyter Hub**](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Session/229081)

📅 Dec 08, 2024, 
🕣 01:00 PM - 04:30 PM EST, 
📍 Capitol/Congress (Marriott Marquis)

This half-day workshop will provide hands-on practice to efficiently use the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) key datasets, open-source tools, and computing resources for exploring, visualizing, analyzing, and communicating science.

## Orals & Oral Sessions
