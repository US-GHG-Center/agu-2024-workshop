# Repository Setup Instructions

The how-tos and tutorials in this repository require a [NASA Earthdata account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/), an installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and a compatible Python Environment.

For local Python environment setup we recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage Python packages. To install *mamba*, download [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for your operating system.  If using Windows, be sure to check the box to "Add mamba to my PATH environment variable" to enable use of mamba directly from your command line interface. **Note that this may cause an issue if you have an existing mamba install through Anaconda.**  

## Python Environment Setup

These Python Environments will work for all of the guides, how-to's, and tutorials within this repository.

1. Using your preferred command line interface (command prompt, terminal, cmder, etc.) navigate to your local copy of the repository, then type the following to create a compatible Python environment.

    For Windows:

    ```cmd
    mamba create -n veda-ghgc -c conda-forge --yes python=3.10 fiona=1.8.22 gdal hvplot geoviews rioxarray rasterio jupyter geopandas earthaccess jupyter_bokeh h5py h5netcdf spectral scikit-image jupyterlab seaborn dask ray-default
    ```

    For MacOSX:

    ```cmd
    mamba create -n veda-ghgc -c conda-forge --yes python=3.10 gdal=3.7.2 hvplot geoviews rioxarray rasterio geopandas fiona=1.9.4 jupyter earthaccess jupyter_bokeh h5py h5netcdf spectral scikit-image seaborn jupyterlab dask ray-default ray-dashboard
    ```

2. Next, activate the Python Environment that you just created.

    ```cmd
    mamba activate veda-ghgc 
    ```

3. Now you can launch Jupyter Notebook to open the notebooks included.

    ```cmd
    jupyter notebook 
    ```
