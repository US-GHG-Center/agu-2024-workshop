# Repository Setup Instructions

The how-tos and tutorials in this repository require a [NASA Earthdata account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/), an installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and a compatible Python Environment.

For local Python environment setup we recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage Python packages. To install *mamba*, download [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for your operating system.  If using Windows, be sure to check the box to "Add mamba to my PATH environment variable" to enable use of mamba directly from your command line interface. **Note that this may cause an issue if you have an existing mamba install through Anaconda.**  

## Python Environment Setup

```cmd
conda create -n veda-ghg
conda activate veda-ghg
```

## Installing packages
Check requirment.txt.
