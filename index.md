# Utilizing Open Science Techniques for Exploring Greenhouse Gas Data: An Interactive Workshop on the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center and VEDA Tools for use in Earth Science Research

ðŸ”— [Session on the AMS Website](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/education-careers/careers/professional-development/short-courses/advancing-open-science-an-interactive-workshop-on-harnessing-veda-for-earth-science-research-at-the-u-s-greenhouse-gas-center/)

## Description

This workshop provides a hands-on learning experience for researchers, educators, and students who are eager to harness NASA's key greenhouse gas datasets, open-source tools, and accessible computing resources for visualizing, exploring, publishing, and communicating scientific results. Participants will learn about and utilize the new U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (GHG Center) to examine curated, trusted data in a cloud computing environment. The activities will center around data and information aligned with three science use cases to ensure broad applicability.  Participants will learn to access analysis workflows using cloud-optimized data, access data products via a standards-based catalog, configure data products for web-based visualizations, and communicate scientific discoveries through a web dashboard. 

The workshop will provide an overview of the newly released U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, a prototype system that aims to integrate federal and non-federal data, reflecting transparency in both data and methods, to address a variety of end user needs for greenhouse gas monitoring and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources. Examples of products that will be part of this training include methane concentration anomalies from space-based instruments (e.g., EMIT), data on natural emissions and fluxes available from the U.S. GHG Center, as well as gridding processes of anthropogenic methane emissions. 

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this workshop, participants will be able to:
1. Understand the scientific basis of the GHG products from the newly formed U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center.
2. Employ Python and Jupyter Notebooks for effective data analysis and visualization of Earth science data in the cloud.
3. Disseminate and share scientific findings to achieve a wider impact.
4. Understand basic principles for contributing to open-sourced software projects.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this workshop includes **Earth Science researchers, educators, and students across all career stages and disciplines who are interested in utilizing GHG datasets and open-source tools for their research projects**. The workshop will be beneficial for both experienced programmers seeking an overview of modern open tools and those just getting started with scientific programming.
