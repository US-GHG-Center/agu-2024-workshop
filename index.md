## Description

This half-day workshop will provide hands-on practice with efficiently using the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) portal datasets, open-source tools, and computing resources for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing greenhouse gas data.  

The US GHG Center portal was created to provide users with access to curated, trusted, and user-friendly greenhouse gas data and information. The portal contents reflect transparency in both data and methods to address different end user needs and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources. The portal contains a growing collection of federal and non-federal data to choose from.

Workshop activities encompass a hands-on demonstration of science questions using activities and portal data, services and tools. Participants will learn from GHG specialists about the latest science for a given region or location as they use the interface, hub cloud computing or QGIS to visualize and analyze the data. Feedback will be solicited to help improve user services and tools. Attendees will produce trends over time, compare data across selected times, utilize code notebooks with different datasets and develop detailed figures and charts. Example python code will be provided so that users can gain practice at using and adapting the open code and focus more on the activity than on building new code given the time limitations.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Better understand GHG products in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center and use the data to answer science questions
2. Use the Exploration and Analysis environment to examine existing datasets and data layers to learn more about GHG emissions patterns
3. Use Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization of Earth science data in the cloud
4. Transition to QGIS and visualize GHG and other science data in a GIS environment with GIS workflows and APIs
5. Understand basic principles for contributing to open-sourced software projects


## Target Audience

The target audience for this workshop includes **Earth Science researchers, educators, and students across all career stages and disciplines who are interested in utilizing GHG datasets and open-source tools for their research projects**. The workshop will be beneficial for both experienced programmers seeking an overview of modern open tools and those just getting started with scientific programming.

## Code of Conduct

This workshop will be held following the [Transform to Open Science Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
