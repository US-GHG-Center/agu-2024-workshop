Participants will learn about and utilize the new U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (GHG Center) to examine curated, trusted data in a cloud computing environment. The activities will center around data and information aligned with three science use cases to ensure broad applicability. Participants will learn to access analysis workflows using cloud-optimized data, access data products via a standards-based catalog, configure data products for web-based visualizations, and communicate scientific discoveries through a web dashboard.\nThe workshop will provide an overview of the newly released U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, a prototype system that aims to integrate federal and non-federal data, reflecting transparency in both data and methods, to address a variety of end user needs for greenhouse gas monitoring and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources. Examples of products that will be part of this training include methane concentration anomalies from space-based instruments (e.g., EMIT), data on natural emissions and fluxes available from the U.S. GHG Center, as well as gridding processes of anthropogenic methane emissions.",

    "text": "Methane (CH‚ÇÑ) emissions from wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of methane in the global CH‚ÇÑ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and anthropogenic emissions. Wetland CH‚ÇÑ is produced by microbes breaking down organic matter in the oxygen deprived environment of inundated soils. Due to limited data availability, the details of the role of wetland CH‚ÇÑ emissions has thus far been underrepresented. Using the Wald Schnee und Landschaft version (LPJ-wsl) of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) global CH‚ÇÑ emissions from wetlands are estimated at 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution by simulating wetland extent and using characteristics of these inundated areas, such as soil moisture, temperature, and carbon content, to estimate CH‚ÇÑ quantities emitted into the atmosphere. Highlighted areas displayed in this dataset show concentrated methane sources from tropical and high latitude ecosystems. The LPJ-wsl Wetland Methane Emissions data product presented here consists of global daily and monthly model estimates of terrestrial wetland CH‚ÇÑ emissions from 1980 - 2021. These data are regularly used in conjunction with NASA‚Äôs Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, to compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions.",

ODIAC pioneered the combined use of space-based nighttime light data and individual power plant emission/location profiles to estimate the global spatial extent of fossil fuel CO‚ÇÇ emissions. With the innovative emission modeling approach, ODIAC achieved the fine picture of global fossil fuel CO‚ÇÇ emissions at a 1x1km.\n\n\n\nPick a collection to interact with.

ODIAC pioneered the combined use of space-based nighttime light data and individual power plant emission/location profiles to estimate the global spatial extent of fossil fuel CO‚ÇÇ emissions. With the innovative emission modeling approach, ODIAC achieved the fine picture of global fossil fuel CO‚ÇÇ emissions at a 1x1km.\n\n\n\nPick a collection to interact with.
