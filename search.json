    "text": "ðŸ”— Session on the AMS Website\n\n\nThis workshop provides a hands-on learning experience for researchers, educators, and students who are eager to harness NASAâ€™s key greenhouse gas datasets, open-source tools, and accessible computing resources for visualizing, exploring, publishing, and communicating scientific results. Participants will learn about and utilize the new U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (GHG Center) to examine curated, trusted data in a cloud computing environment. The activities will center around data and information aligned with three science use cases to ensure broad applicability. Participants will learn to access analysis workflows using cloud-optimized data, access data products via a standards-based catalog, configure data products for web-based visualizations, and communicate scientific discoveries through a web dashboard.\nThe workshop will provide an overview of the newly released U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, a prototype system that aims to integrate federal and non-federal data, reflecting transparency in both data and methods, to address a variety of end user needs for greenhouse gas monitoring and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources. Examples of products that will be part of this training include methane concentration anomalies from space-based instruments (e.g., EMIT), data on natural emissions and fluxes available from the U.S. GHG Center, as well as gridding processes of anthropogenic methane emissions.\n\n\n\nUpon completing this workshop, participants will be able to: 1. Understand the scientific basis of the GHG products from the newly formed U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center. 2. Employ Python and Jupyter Notebooks for effective data analysis and visualization of Earth science data in the cloud. 3. Disseminate and share scientific findings to achieve a wider impact. 4. Understand basic principles for contributing to open-sourced software projects.\n\n\n\nThe target audience for this workshop includes Earth Science researchers, educators, and students across all career stages and disciplines who are interested in utilizing GHG datasets and open-source tools for their research projects. The workshop will be beneficial for both experienced programmers seeking an overview of modern open tools and those just getting started with scientific programming.\n\n\n\nThe full-day workshop will be divided into the following sections:\n\nWelcome (0:00 - 0:10)\n\nWorkshop Introduction\nTeam Introduction\n\nOverview of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (0:10 - 0:30)\n\nIntro to the VEDA project and its relevance to Earth Science research and the US GHG Center\nWhat is the US GHG Center?\nIntroduction to the science use cases / demonstration areas that will be explored - during the workshop\n\nIntroduction to STAC Catalog (0:30 - 1:00)\n\nWhat is a STAC catalog?\nHands-on exercise: searching and accessing cloud-optimized datasets using the - STAC catalog\n\nAccessing GHG Center Data in STAC\n\n\nPython and Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis and Visualization (1:00 - 1:15)\n\nIntro to Jupyter Notebooks\nHands-on exercise: user notebook access and practice environment\n\nSetting the Scope for Interactive Sessions (1:15 - 1:35)\n\nRole of Methane and Carbon Dioxide in Climate Change\nSession Objectives / Goal\nDescription of Areas of Interest (AOI)\n\nBREAK (1:35 - 1:50)\nInteractive Session 1: EPA Gridded Methane Emissions Inventory (1:50 - 2:50)\n\nBackground and gridding methods overview/ example\nImproving access and latency of human anthropogenic emissions\nHands-on exercise:\n\nInteractive Session 2: Complementing anthropogenic GHG emissions with natural GHG emissions and fluxes (2:50 - 3:50)\n\nDescription of data sets and analysis available via the U.S. GHG Center (e.g., gridded wetland emissions and ecosystem exchange estimates)\nHands-on exercise: Exploring annual U.S. wetland methane emissions and their - meteorological influences.\n\nBREAK (3:50 - 4:05)\n\nInteractive Session 3: Identifying and quantifying emissions from large point source methane emission events leveraging aircraft and satellite data (4:05 - 5:05)\nDescription of data sets and analysis available via the U.S. GHG Center (e.g., EMIT methane enhancements; plans for emission rates, CO2, etc.)\nHands-on exercise: Locating enhancement, understanding temporal relevance, exploring site with multiple observations.\n\nOpen Science in Action: Intro to GitHub & Communicating Science Discoveries via Web Dashboard (5:05 - 5:50)\n\nHow do VEDA, GitHub, and JupyterHub interoperate and why is this important?\n\nHands-on exercise:\n\nIntroduction to web dashboards for science communication\n\nHands-on exercise: creating a web dashboard to communicate science discoveries - using the platform\n\n\nClosing Remarks (5:50 - 6:00)\n\nFuture Developments and Community Contributions\nEngaging with the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center\n\n\nThroughout the workshop, facilitators will be available to provide support and guidance, ensuring participants are able to actively explore the workshop topics and apply their knowledge and skills to their own research projects."
