The GHG Center portal provides cloud optimized access to a growing set of federal and non-federal data. The contents reflect transparency in both data and methods, to address different end user needs and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources.\nWorkshop activities encompass exploration of several science questions and activities using the US GHG Center services and tools. Participants will learn from GHG specialists about the latest science or policies that can be identified in the data for a given region or location. Attendees will produce trends over time, visually compare data from selected times, utilize code notebooks to compare datasets and develop detailed figures and comparison charts and to summarize and share results. Example python code will be provided so that users can gain practice at using and adapting the open code and focus more on the activity than on building new code given the time limitations.",
