The dataset contains emissions over the contiguous United States covering major anthropogenic sectors, including energy, industrial fuel combustion and processes, commercial and residential combustion, oil and gas production, on-road and off-road transportation, etc. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions are developed along with those of air pollutants including CO, NOₓ, SO₂, and PM2.5 with consistency in spatial and temporal distributions. Emissions by sectors are reported as column totals in units of metric tons per km² per month. Spatial-temporal surrogates are developed to distribute CO₂ emissions to grid cells to keep consistency between greenhouse gases and air quality species. The current version of GRA²PES is for 2021. Long-term emissions and more greenhouse gas species (e.g., methane) are under development and will be added in the future.",

    "text": "Use GHG Center Data in QGIS - Part 1\n\nAdding the LPJ Wetlands data\n\nGo to “Plugins → STAC API Browser Plugin → Open STAC API Browser” to open the STAC browser. In the “Connections” menu, make sure “US GHG Center STAC” is selected.\nClick the “Fetch collections” button. You should see a list of all available datasets.\nSelect “(Daily) Wetland Methane Emissions, LPJ-EOSIM Model v2”. Then, click “Search. This will take a few seconds.\nWhen complete, switch to the “Results” tab at the top. You should see several dates for LPJ-EOSIM data outputs. Select the one acquired 7/31/2024 and click “View assets”. In the opened window, find the “Ensemble mean” output (should be the third one), click “Select to add as layer”, and then click “Add assets as layers”. The dataset should appear in rendered form in your QGIS window.\nYou can now close all the popup windows and focus on the main QGIS window.\n\n\n\nLoading some shapefiles\n\nIn the QGIS menu, go to “Layer → Add Layer → Add vector layer”. This should open a Data Source Manager window.\nMake sure the window is focused on “Vector” and the Source Type is “File”. Click the “…” next to the “Source” box to open a new file browser window. Find the tl_2024_us_state.zip file, select it, and click “Open”. In the Data Source Manager window, click “Add”.\n\nNOTE: You may be prompted by a menu asking how to reproject the dataset to match the project. Select the first option.\n\nUsing the same methods, also add the ne_10m_lakes and ne_10m_rverse_lake_centerlines vector layers.\nModify the aesthetics of the resulting map to make it easier to visually explore. For each layer, right click it, select “Properties”, and then, in the Symbology menu, modify the color mapping to improve the visuals of the map.\n\nChange the lakes layer to use the preset “outline blue”.\nChange the LPJ methane layer to use a Singleband pseudocolor render type, with a “Magma” color ramp, and set min/max values to “Cumulative count cut – 2% to 100%”.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating zonal statistics\n\nShow the processing toolbox (if it isn’t shown already): View → Panels → Processing Toolbox (check)\nIn the Processing Toolbox, search for “Zonal statistics”. Double click the tool to open it. (It should be under “Raster analysis”\nIn the Zonal statistics window, select the following:\n\nInput layer: The vector layer against which to aggregate (in this case, tl_2024_us_state.shp)\nRaster layer: The raster layer that will be aggregated.\nRaster band: The band to aggregate (should only be one band)\nStatistics to calculate: Select Sum and Mean (and any others of interest).\n\nYou should now have a new (temporary) layer called “Zonal statistics” displayed, but all as one color.\nVisualize the differences in the values:\n\nRight click on the Zonal Statistics layer\nSelect “Properties”\nAt the top of the Symbology tab, change “Single Symbol” to “Graduated”.\nSelect “_sum” as the “value”.\nSelect “equal interval” as the classification scheme and click “classify”.\nClick “Apply” and close out of the window.\n\nThe resulting map gives the total methane emissions by state.\n\nQuestion: Why is Alaska the only state with any colors?\nAnswer: Because it’s so big, it has a lot of CH4 pixels, so the total emissions are large even if the per-pixel emissions are not.\n\nTo inspect the values for any particular state:\n\nSelect the corresponding Zonal Statistics layer in the Layers box.\nIn the Attributes Toolbar, select the Identify Features tool (should be in the first row under the QGIS menus; look for the icon of an arrow pointing at an “i” in a circle)\n\n\nExercise:\n\n\nDifferences between two rasters\n\nFollowing the method above, load daily LPJ-EOSIM data for 2024-07-30, but instead of the ensemble mean, load the MERRA-2 and ERA-5 layers.\nRight click on each layer and give them a more abbreviated informative name (e.g., “LPJ ERA5/MERRA-2 2024-07-30”).\nIn the tools panel, find and open the Raster calculator tool.\nIn the Raster calculator tool, click the “…” next to “Input layers” and select the LPJ ERA5/MERRA-2 layers.\nClick the symbol next to the “Expression”.\nIn the Expression window, double click the LPJ ERA5 layer to add it to the expression, then double click the LPJ MERRA-2 layer to add it to the expression. Note that the expression region is plain text, so you can easily manipulate it. Use this interface to produce an equation like the following: (“LPJ-ERA5” - “LPJ-MERRA2”) / (“LPJ-ERA5” + “LPJ-MERRA2”). Once you are satisfied, exit the Expression window.\nLeave the other fields at their defaults and click “run”. After a few seconds, you should see a new “Calculated” layer.\nModify its visualization to more effectively spot differences (hint: try a “Singleband pseudocolor” with a “RdBl” color palette centered on zero).\n\n\n\nExploration exercises\n\nExperiment with tweaking your visualizations\nLook at other GHG-Center layers\nLook at some other shapefiles, aggregations etc.\nLook at more sophisticated raster calculations.",

The portal contents reflect transparency in both data and methods to address different end user needs and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources. The portal contains a growing collection of federal and non-federal data to choose from.\nWorkshop activities encompass a hands-on demonstration of science questions using activities and portal data, services and tools. Participants will learn from GHG specialists about the latest science for a given region or location as they use the interface, hub cloud computing or QGIS to visualize and analyze the data. Feedback will be solicited to help improve user services and tools. Attendees will produce trends over time, compare data across selected times, utilize code notebooks with different datasets and develop detailed figures and charts. Example python code will be provided so that users can gain practice at using and adapting the open code and focus more on the activity than on building new code given the time limitations.",

The monthly dataset is computed by summing the daily data for each month. The estimates are regularly used in conjunction with NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, to compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions.

Methane emissions from vegetated wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of methane in the global CH₄ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and anthropogenic emissions. Wetland CH₄ is produced by microbes breaking down organic matter in the oxygen deprived environment of inundated soils. Due to limited data availability, the details of the role of wetland CH₄ emissions have thus far been underrepresented. The LPJ-EOSIM model estimates wetland methane emissions by simulating wetland extent and using characteristics of these inundated areas such as soil moisture, temperature, and carbon content to estimate CH₄ quantities emitted into the atmosphere. Input climate forcing data comes from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) data and ECMWF Re-Analysis data (ERA5). An ensemble layer provides the result of the mean of the MERRA-2 and ERA5 layers. All data layers are in units of kilograms of methane per meter squared per second.

The state of Louisiana encompasses a diverse range of non-tidal and tidal freshwater wetlands including palustrine, lacustrine, riverine, estuarine, and marine wetlands. These ecosystems cover roughly one-third of the state according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, making Louisiana an ideal site for monitoring the natural source of methane emissions.\nOur AOI is defined by a polygon, and there are several methods for defining our polygon - here we read in a GEOJSON created by using geojson.io. If you want to look at data over a different region, try drawing your own AOI and dropping the GEOJSON into this directory!\nWe also include an example of how to read geospatial information from a shapefile.\n\n# We'll use geopandas to read our GEOJSON, which defines a polygon over our AOI.\nlouisiana_aoi = gpd.read_file('./louisiana.geojson')\n\n\n## Method #2 of defining a polygon - using a shapefile!\n## An individual shapefile has a .shp extension,\n## but comes packaged with several supplemental files, typically in .zip format.\n## Here we have unpacked the contents of a .zip from the Census Bureau\n## in data/cb_2018_us_state_20m\n## We'll use geopandas to read the .shp file found there and isolate Louisiana.\n## Uncomment the next two lines to use the shapefile!\n# \n#gdf = gpd.read_file('./data/cb_2018_us_state_20m/cb_2018_us_state_20m.shp')\n#louisiana_aoi = gdf[gdf['NAME'] == 'Louisiana']",

For example, one might examine meteorological variables from MERRA-2, a reanalysis product from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, to see whether precipitation or surface temperature are related to higher methane emissions.\nWe have provided below the steps for connecting to NASA Earthdata, but we will not be demonstrating this capability during the workshop. Feel free to experiment with this later on!\n\nNASA Earth Data Login Credentials\nTo download or stream NASA data you will need an Earthdata account, you can create one here https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home. We will use the login function from the earthaccess library for authentication before downloading at the end of the notebook. This function can also be used to create a local .netrc file if it doesn’t exist or add your login info to an existing .netrc file.

    "text": "Use GHG Center Data in QGIS - Part 2\n\nLoad data\n\nOpen the STAC browser.\nIn the STAC browser, select the two “Vulcan” collections and click “Search”.\nIn the STAC browser Results tab, locate the vulcan_ffco2_yeargrid_v4_2021 dataset, click “View assets”, and add the “Total of all sectors CO2 emissions” layer to your map.\nAs before, use the Layer → Add Vector Layer approach to find and add the US Census urban area (“tl_2024_us_uac20”) and combined statistical area (“tl_2024_us_cbsa”) to your map.\nAs before, use the Zonal Statistics tool to calculate the sum and mean values by city. Rename the resulting layer to something like “Vulcan CSBA” (as appropriate).\nRight click the new Vulcan CSBA layer and click “Open Attribute Table”. In the attribute table, scroll all the way to the right and click on the “_sum” field to sort by that field. Click again to switch the sorting order.\n\nExercise: Which CBSAs have the largest emissions?\n\n\n\n\nComparing GRA2PES and Vulcan\nExercise Questions\n1. Add Data:\n- Add the Vulcan and GRA2PES total CO₂ emissions datasets from STAC\n- Add the CBSA shapefile\n2. Convert Monthly to Annual:\n- Convert the GRA2PES monthly CO₂ emissions data to annual data using the Raster Calculator.\n3. Perform Zonal Statistics:\n- Conduct zonal statistics for both the Vulcan and GRA2PES datasets using the Combined Statistical Area (CBSA) shapefile.\n4. Join Datasets and Analyze Differences:\n- Join the annual CO₂ emissions data for both datasets.\n- Use the Join and the _Field Calculato_r to analyze the differences between the two datasets.\nHint: Use the Join to combine datasets and the Field Calculator to compute differences.\nVulcan data are already annual. GRA2PES data are monthly, so they will need to be aggregated to annual.\n\nOpen the STAC browser, select the GRA2PES collection, and click “Search”.\nIn the Results tab, you should see monthly emissions layers from GRA2PES. For every month, add the CO2 emissions layer to your map.\n\nIt’s a good idea to rename each layer to include the month (e.g., “GRA2PES 01”), to make the layers easier to inspect later.\nTo tidy up your layer list, you can also shift-click all of the GRA2PES layers, right click on one of the selected layers, and click “Group” to bundle them all under a single group (which can also be renamed).\n\nOpen the Raster Calculator. Add all of the GRA2PES layers to the list of layers. Then, in the expression, add all the layers together. Click “Run”. When complete, rename the resulting layer to “GRA2PES 2021” (or similar).\nUse the Zonal Statistics tool to calculate the sum and mean values of the GRA2PES annual data. Rename this layer to “GRA2PES CBSA” (or similar).\nRight click the new “GRA2PES CBSA” layer and click “Properties”. Go to “Joins” and click the green plus at the bottom to add a join. In the Join window, select “Vulcan CBSA” (or whatever you named it) as the join layer and “CSAFP” as the join field and target field. Click OK in the join window, and OK again in the Properties window.\nRight click the GRA2PES CBSA layer and select “Open Attribute Table”. Scroll all the way to the right to confirm that there are some fields like “Vulcan CBSA _mean” in the table.\nIn the attribute table popup, click the “Open Field Calculator” button (abacus icon; should be 4th from the right). In the Field Calculator window:\n\nMake sure “Create a new field” and “Create virtual field” are both selected. Give the output field name “sum_difference” and set the field type to “decimal (double)”.\nFind and open the “Fields and Values” selection. Find the “_sum” field (or search for “_sum”) and double click it to add it to the Expression. Then, click the “minus” in the expression field (or type a minus). Then, find the “Vulcan CBSA_sum” field and double click it to add it to the Expression. You should now have an expression like ”_sum” - “Vulcan CBSA__sub”. Click “OK”.\n\nRepeat the above step with the _mean values (calling the virtual layer “mean_difference”).\nVisualize the results:\n\nRight click the “GRA2PES CBSA” layer, click “Properties”, and go to “Symbology”.\nChange the type to “Graduated”, set the value to “sum_difference”, and select a red-blue color ramp.\nSet the mode to “Equal interval” with 10 classes.\nCheck “Symmetric Classification” and set the “Around” value to 0.00.\nClick “Apply” or “OK.\n\nRepeat the previous step with the mean_difference.",
