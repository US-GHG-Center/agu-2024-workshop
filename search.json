Participants will learn about and utilize the new U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (GHG Center) to examine curated, trusted data in a cloud computing environment. The activities will center around data and information aligned with three science use cases to ensure broad applicability. Participants will learn to access analysis workflows using cloud-optimized data, access data products via a standards-based catalog, configure data products for web-based visualizations, and communicate scientific discoveries through a web dashboard.\nThe workshop will provide an overview of the newly released U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, a prototype system that aims to integrate federal and non-federal data, reflecting transparency in both data and methods, to address a variety of end user needs for greenhouse gas monitoring and to bring together actionable information from multiple sources. Examples of products that will be part of this training include methane concentration anomalies from space-based instruments (e.g., EMIT), data on natural emissions and fluxes available from the U.S. GHG Center, as well as gridding processes of anthropogenic methane emissions."
